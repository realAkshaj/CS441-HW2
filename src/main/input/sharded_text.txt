thought to date from the end of this period around in that year he took the civil service exam likely in chang an he failed to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure while chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame after this failure he went back to traveling this time around shandong and hebei his father died around du fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father s rank but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers he spent the next four years living in the luoyang area fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs in the autumn of he met li bai li po for the first time and the two poets formed a friendship david young describes this as the most significant formative element in du fu s artistic development because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam the relationship was somewhat one sided however du fu was by some years the younger while li bai was already a poetic star we have twelve poems to or about li bai from the younger poet but only one in the other direction they met again only once in in he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career he took the civil service exam a second time during the following year but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals he never again attempted the examinations instead petitioning the emperor directly in and probably again in he married around and by the couple had had five children three sons and two daughters but one of the sons died in infancy in from he began to have lung problems probably asthma the first of a series of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life it was in that year that du fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region in he received an appointment as registrar of the right commandant s office of the crown prince s palace although this was a minor post in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career even before he had begun work however the position was swept away by events war the an lushan rebellion began in december and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years it caused enormous disruption to chinese society the census of recorded million people but ten years later the census counted just million the remainder having been displaced or killed during this time du fu led a largely itinerant life unsettled by wars associated famines and imperial displeasure this period of unhappiness was the making of du fu as a poet even shan chou has written that what he saw around him the lives of his family neighbors and strangers what he heard and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns these became the enduring themes of his poetry even when he learned of the death of his youngest child he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own misfortunes du fu wrote brooding on what i have lived through if even i know such suffering the common man must surely be rattled by the winds in emperor xuanzong was forced to flee the capital and abdicate du fu who had been away from the city took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor suzong but he was captured by the rebels and taken to chang an in the autumn his youngest son du zongwu baby bear was born around this time du fu is
thought to have contracted malaria he escaped from chang an the following year and was appointed reminder when he rejoined the court in may this post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial du fu s conscientiousness compelled him to try to make use of it he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron fang guan on a petty charge he was arrested but was pardoned in june he was granted leave to visit his family in september but he soon rejoined the court and on december he returned to chang an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces however his advice continued to be unappreciated and in the summer of he was demoted to a post as commissioner of education in huazhou the position was not to his taste in one poem he wrote i am about to scream madly in the office especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk he moved on in the summer of this has traditionally been ascribed to famine but hung believes that frustration is a more likely reason he next spent around six weeks in qinzhou now tianshui gansu province where he wrote more than sixty poems chengdu in december he briefly stayed in tonggu modern gansu he departed on december for chengdu sichuan province where he was hosted by local prefect and fellow poet pei di du subsequently based himself in sichuan for most of the next five years by the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances he was relieved by yan wu a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at chengdu despite his financial problems this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life many of du s poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at thatched hut in he left the city to escape a rebellion but he returned in summer when he was appointed an advisor to yan who was involved in campaigns against the tibetan empire last years luoyang the region of his birthplace was recovered by government forces in the winter of and in the spring of du fu and his family sailed down the yangtze apparently with the intention of making their way there they traveled slowly held up by his ill health by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments they stayed in kuizhou in what is now baidicheng chongqing at the entrance to the three gorges for almost two years from late spring this period was du fu s last great poetic flowering and here he wrote poems in his dense late style in autumn bo maolin became governor of the region he supported du fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary in march he began his journey again and got as far as hunan province where he died in tanzhou now changsha in november or december in his th year he was survived by his wife and two sons who remained in the area for some years at least his last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from yuan zhen in hung summarises his life by concluding that he appeared to be a filial son an affectionate father a generous brother a faithful husband a loyal friend a dutiful official and a patriotic subject below is an example of one of du fu s later works to my retired friend wei chinese like many other poems in the tang it featured the theme of a long parting between friends which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces works criticism of du fu s works has focused on his strong sense of history his moral engagement and his technical excellence history since the song dynasty critics have called du fu the poet historian sh sh the most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures
of the government or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor indirectly he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself and on the ordinary people of china as watson notes this is information of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era du fu s political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation his prescriptions have been paraphrased as let us all be less selfish let us all do what we are supposed to do since his views were impossible to disagree with his forcefully expressed truisms enabled his installation as the central figure of chinese poetic history moral engagement a second favourite epithet of chinese critics is that of poet sage sh shng a counterpart to the philosophical sage confucius one of the earliest surviving works the song of the wagons from around gives voice to the sufferings of a conscript soldier in the imperial army and a clear sighted consciousness of suffering these concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by du fu throughout his life although du fu s frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all consuming solipsism hawkes argues that his famous compassion in fact includes himself viewed quite objectively and almost as an afterthought he therefore lends grandeur to the wider picture by comparing it to his own slightly comical triviality du fu s compassion for himself and for others was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment zhang jie wrote that for du fu everything in this world is poetry du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life calligraphy paintings animals and other poems technical excellence du fu s work is notable above all for its range chinese critics traditionally used the term jdchng complete symphony a reference to mencius description of confucius yuan zhen was the first to note the breadth of du fu s achievement writing in that his predecessor united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly he mastered all the forms of chinese poetry chou says that in every form he either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples furthermore his poems use a wide range of registers from the direct and colloquial to the allusive and self consciously literary this variety is manifested even within individual works owen identifies the rapid stylistic and thematic shifts in poems which enable the poet to represent different facets of a situation while chou uses the term juxtaposition as the major analytical tool in her work du fu is noted for having written more on poetics and painting than any other writer of his time he wrote eighteen poems on painting alone more than any other tang poet du fu s seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of han gan ignited a controversy that has persisted to the present day the tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings chameleon like according to watson his earliest works are in a relatively derivative courtly style but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion owen comments on the grim simplicity of the qinzhou poems which mirrors the desert landscape the works from his chengdu period are light often finely observed while the poems from the late kuizhou period have a density and power of vision although he wrote in all poetic forms du fu is best known for his lshi a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content for example about two thirds of du fu s extant works are in this form and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent his best lshi use the parallelisms required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions hawkes comments that it is amazing that tu fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner
